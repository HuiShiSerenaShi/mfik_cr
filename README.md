# Zeroing Neural Network for Model-Free Inverse Kinematics Control of Robotic Arms

This repository provides the implementation of a Zeroing Neural Network (ZNN) for model-free inverse kinematics control of robotic arms. The project aims to achieve real-time, high-precision trajectory tracking without relying on explicit kinematic models. 

Key features include:
Efficient and adaptive error convergence mechanisms.
Robust performance in unstructured and dynamic environments.
